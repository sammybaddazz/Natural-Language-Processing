# Natural-Language-Processing
I am creating an NLG project. I will create a data warehouse with 20 GB of xml files. They contain product information for automotive parts. I want to generate new content based off the reading of the data files.
Project Scope:
1.	Ingestion:
a.	Set up the data warehouse:
b.	Choose a data warehouse platform that suits your requirements and budget
c.	Create a new database/schema within the data warehouse to hold the PIES data.
d.	Create the necessary tables with appropriate columns and data types to hold the PIES data.
e.	Ensure that the data warehouse can handle the size of your PIES files.
f.	Set up Apache NiFi:
g.	Install and configure NiFi on a machine that has access to both the source and destination locations.
h.	Set up a NiFi processor group to handle the PIES data ingestion process.
i.	Configure NiFi processors:
j.	Use the 'GetFile' processor to read PIES XML files from the source location.
k.	Use the 'EvaluateXPath' processor to parse the XML files and extract the required data. For example, you can extract the vehicle fitment, brand name, and part type name from each PIES record.
l.	Use the 'PutDatabaseRecord' processor to insert the extracted data into the data warehouse.
m.	Test and monitor the ingestion process:
n.	Run the NiFi processor group and monitor the logs to ensure that data is being ingested successfully.
o.	Perform some basic data quality checks to ensure that the data is being ingested correctly.
2.	Data Preprocessing:
a.	Preprocess the PIES XML data by parsing the data and transforming it into a structured format. 
b.	Enrich the data with additional information from external sources, 
i.	product taxonomy data
ii.	manufacturer catalogs
1.	PDFs
iii.	other relevant data sources.
3.	Data labeling: 
a.	Label the data by vehicle fitment, brand name, and part type name. You can use manual labeling or automated labeling techniques, such as rule-based labeling or active learning.
b.	Collect and preprocess your data: Gather the data you want to label and preprocess it to ensure it's in a format that can be easily ingested by a machine learning model. 
c.	Choose a labeling technique: There are various techniques you can use for automated labeling, including keyword-based approaches, clustering, and active learning. Choose a technique that best fits your data and labeling needs.
d.	Train your model: Use your labeled data to train a machine learning model to automatically label your data. You can use a variety of tools and libraries to do this, such as scikit-learn or TensorFlow.
e.	Evaluate your model: Once your model is trained, evaluate its performance by comparing its predictions against ground-truth labels. This will help you identify areas for improvement and refine your labeling process.
f.	Refine and iterate: Use the insights gained from evaluating your model to refine your labeling process and iterate on your approach. Over time, you can continue to improve your model's performance and automate more of your labeling process.
g.	Tools
i.	Snorkel: a framework for creating training sets through weak supervision
ii.	Prodigy: a tool for interactive data labeling and annotation
iii.	Label Studio: an open-source tool for data labeling and annotation
iv.	Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth: a managed service for data labeling and annotation
4.	NLP Model Training:
a.	Use spaCy to train an NLP model on the labeled data. You can use various NLP techniques, such as entity recognition, text classification, or semantic similarity, to identify similarities in the data.
5.	NLP Model Deployment:
a.	Package the trained NLP model into a deployable format.
b.	Deploy the model on a server.
6.	Content Generation Model Training:
a.	Use the trained NLP model to generate high-quality content.
b.	Train a content generation model on the generated content.
c.	Fine-tune the model for specific use cases.
d.	Evaluate the model and tune its hyperparameters for better performance.
7.	Content Generation Model Deployment:
a.	Package the trained content generation model into a deployable format.
b.	Deploy the model on a server.
8.	Monitoring and Maintenance:
a.	Monitor the deployed models for performance issues.
b.	Maintain the deployed models and update them as needed.
Tools
1.	Data ingestion: 
1.	Apache Nifi
2.	Data preprocessing: 
1.	Python libraries like BeautifulSoup, 
2.	Lxml 
3.	Pandas 
4.	for parsing and transforming the data, and external data sources such as product taxonomy data and manufacturer catalogs for enriching the data.
3.	Data labeling: 
1.	Automated data labeling
1.	Snorkel
2.	Prodigy. 
2.	Manual labeling
1.	Doccano
2.	Labelbox
4.	Model training: spaCy for training an NLP model on the labeled data using techniques like entity recognition, text classification, and semantic similarity.
5.	Model evaluation: Python libraries like scikit-learn for measuring accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score on a validation dataset.
6.	Model deployment: Flask or FastAPI for deploying the trained NLP model into production as a standalone application or as part of a larger pipeline.
7.	Content generation: For generating content, you could use techniques like template-based generation, language models like GPT-3, or neural text generation using frameworks like Tensorflow or PyTorch.
8.	Model refinement: Tools like Active Learning or Human-in-the-Loop Learning can be used for continuous refinement of the model by collecting feedback from users and improving the data labeling and training process.
9.	Deployment and monitoring: Docker and Kubernetes can be used for deployment, and monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana can be used to monitor the performance and user feedback of the deployed model.
